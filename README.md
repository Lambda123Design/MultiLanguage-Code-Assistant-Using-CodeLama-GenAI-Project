# MultiLanguage-Code-Assistant-Using-CodeLama-GenAI-Project
This Repository contains my working files on "MultiLanguage Code Assistant Using CodeLama Project", an GenAI Project

(i) Developed an end-to-end code assistant named "Code Guru" using Code Llama, an open-source LLM from Meta specialized for coding tasks.

(ii) Integrated it to run the model locally or in the cloud, supporting multiple programming languages such as Python, Java, C++, PHP, TypeScript, C#, and Bash.

(iii) Implemented a custom GPT-like assistant with a system prompt defining its role, and configured model parameters such as temperature for creativity.

(iv) Built a Gradio-based front end to interact with the assistant, enabling users to input prompts and receive real-time code generation responses.

(v) Maintained conversation history to allow context-aware multi-turn interactions, so the assistant can answer follow-up queries accurately.
